  <h2>Volunteering and Other Activities</h2>
  <p>I spent three years as a teenager engaging with the British Youth Council as a Member of Youth Parliament,
    during which I led sessions on public speaking, campaigning and interpersonal skills, as well as leading a
    four-month engagement campaign which led to 800,000 young people having their voices heard in the region I
    was responsible for (North West England). Furthermore I was active on the University Air Squadron during my
    short time in Durham. I also speak French at an advanced level and Spanish conversationally. I am a highly
    disciplined worker, learning Greek and Mandarin Chinese in my spare time. <br><br>
    I have recently started tutoring Maths and Physics and now have an average of five GCSE / A Level students
    at any one time - I prepare all of my own lesson materials and I have received positive feedback from a
    number of past students. I am currently teaching myself Python with an end-goal of one day working part-time
    as a web developer or software engineer.
