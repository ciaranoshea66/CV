            was responsible for (North West England). Furthermore I was active on the University Air Squadron during my
            short time in Durham. I also speak French at an advanced level and Spanish conversationally. I am a highly
            disciplined worker, learning Greek and Mandarin Chinese in my spare time. <br><br>
